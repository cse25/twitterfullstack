Build a full stack MVP of a website where I should be able to put in a twitter username and get back that person's last 25 tweets. You need to start this assignment from scratch. 

Client side:
-I need an input field for a twitter username, which should notify your server
-An area to display the resulted tweets
-If you get extra time, use Angular to make it look more presentable

Server side:
Given the inputted username, interact with the twitter api to get the last 25 tweets (hint: there are node modules out there that will help you get this information), send that information back to your client

When are you finished, email la.communcation@makersquare.com your completed assignment. Please note that this is graded, and if you are not finished, turn in what you have by 5:30pm. Late assignments will not be accepted.
